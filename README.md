# MMM-KeyPress

This is a module for Magic Mirror software and is solely built to allow user interaction with MMM-CalendarExt3 (https://github.com/MMRIZE/MMM-CalendarExt3).

Once configured, arrow keys or swiping will allow the MMM-CalendarExt3 calendar to advance forward and backwards by month. With a 10 point touch screen, users can use 1-10 fingers to swipe and the calendar will advance 1-10 months.
